    <h1>Biography</h1>
    
    <p>
    Hey, my name is Jack. I am a first year Computing Undergraduate at Imperial College London. 
    One area of computing I am particularly interested in is object-oriented programming.
    Before studying at Imperial, I studied at The Billericay School and Westcliff High School for Boys Sixth Form . 
    I enjoy playing the piano, especially jazz and classical music.<br><br>
    I first realised I wanted to study computing when my A Level maths teacher started discussing computer-assisted proofs, and why some people didn’t accept their validity. 
    I was extremely intrigued, and so decided to complete my Extended Project on it. Since then, I have realised that computer science is a much wider area than just writing programs, and that is why I want to learn more about it.<br><br>
    In my free time, I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music, especially pop. 
    When I’m not working, I enjoy spending time with my friends all over the country. 
    I also love to travel - my favourite experiences are surfing in Santa Barbara, California, visiting museums in Washington DC, visiting the Colosseum in Rome, Italy, driving a Jeep across sand dunes in Oman, and visiting the world’s tallest building in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
