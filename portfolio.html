    <h2>Deep Learning in Medical Imaging Analysis</h2>
    <p>This project was undertaken as my first year group project, and involved creating a website discussing the uses of AI in Medical Imaging Analysis.<br>
    Our main areas of research were to look into the history and evolution of medical imaging and machine learning as separate topics, and then find areas in which they overlapped.
    We looked at Convolutional Neural Networks, along with Semantic Segmentation, as these are the most commmonplace in medical imaging.
    We then looked at overlapping topics, these being the uses of AI in radiology, and a deeper case study into the user for detection of lung cancer.<br>
    We also had to create a website for this, which can be accessed <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jce317/">here</a>.
